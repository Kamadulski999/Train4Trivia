# Trivia Trainer
 TriviaTrainer is a web application for practicing trivia questions
 The user selects a category and number of questions from the dropdown menus and after hitting the "Start Training" button questions are retrieved from The Open Trivia     Database, and formatted for display</br></br>
 TriviaTrainer was bootsrapped using Create-React-App and relies on the Bootstrap CSS library. Deployed using AWS Beanstalk. 

 This app was originally written using JQuery as the first group project in Washington University Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp. At the time, we had only been introduced to JS for 3 weeks and were bound by the requirements of the class assignment. After graduating bootcamp, I decided to re-make the app using React.js for practice. Along the way I corrected several of the issues seen when first writing this code as a group project. </br></br>
